description: "The core values of AI-Native Engineering"

## We have come to value:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Building with context over coding from scratch">
    AI-Native teams leverage accumulated knowledge, patterns, and context rather than starting every solution from zero. Context becomes the foundation that accelerates every new endeavor.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agents as teammates over agents as tools">
    AI agents are not just utilities to be commanded—they are collaborative partners that bring unique capabilities to the team. We design workflows that treat them as first-class participants.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Precision with intent over compliance with process">
    We focus on clearly communicating what we want to achieve, not on following rigid procedures. Intent-driven development allows both humans and AI to find optimal paths to goals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Continuous evolution over static perfection">
    In a world where change is constant, we build systems that adapt and learn rather than systems that resist change. Perfection is a moving target, not a fixed destination.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shared understanding over isolated expertise">
    Knowledge should flow freely between humans and AI, across teams and systems. We build bridges, not silos.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Systems that learn over systems that lock-in">
    We prefer architectures and approaches that grow smarter over time, rather than those that create dependencies and technical debt.
  </Accordion>
