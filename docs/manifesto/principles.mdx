## Guiding Principles

These principles guide how we approach software development in the age of intelligent collaboration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design for Adaptation">
    We design for *adaptation*, not *completion*. Systems should evolve with changing requirements and new insights.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Living Artifacts">
    Every artifact — code, spec, or insight — is a **living node** in a learning loop. Nothing is truly "done."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Observe, Reason, Evolve">
    We build systems that **observe, reason, and evolve** with their environment. Static systems become obsolete.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Human Direction, Machine Exploration">
    Human intuition sets direction; machine intelligence accelerates exploration. The partnership multiplies capabilities.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trust Through Transparency">
    Transparency and traceability are essential — **trust is the new build system**. We must understand what AI produces.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Conversation, Not Command">
    Collaboration between humans and agents must feel like *conversation*, not *command*. Natural interaction enables better outcomes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Measure Understanding">
    We measure progress by **shared understanding and capability**, not velocity alone. Speed without comprehension is dangerous.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Augmentation, Not Automation">
    The future of engineering is not automation — it's *augmentation*. AI amplifies human capability, not replaces it.
  </Step>
</Steps>
