title: The AI-Native Engineering Manifesto
description: Defining the principles of software creation in the age of intelligent collaboration
---

AI is transforming how software is imagined, built, and evolved.

We are no longer just coding — we are conversing, co-creating, and continuously learning with intelligent systems.

**AI-Native Engineering** is the craft of aligning human intent and machine intelligence into one continuous flow of discovery, design, and delivery.

## The Movement

AI-Native Engineering represents a fundamental shift in how we build software. It's not about replacing humans with AI—it's about creating a new kind of collaboration where human creativity and machine intelligence amplify each other.
